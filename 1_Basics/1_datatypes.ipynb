In this tutorial, we'll take a look at the most commonly used DataTypes in TensorFlow and creating neural network models, namely ___Constant___, ___Variable___, and ___Placeholder___. This will also enable us to shed light on some of the points and questions left unanswered in the previous post.\n",
