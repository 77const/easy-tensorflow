    "\n",
    "__TensorBoard__ is a visualization software that comes with any standard TensorFlow installation. In Google’s words: “The computations you'll use TensorFlow for (like training a massive deep neural network) can be complex and confusing. To make it easier to understand, debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs, we've included a suite of visualization tools called TensorBoard.”\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow programs can range from  very simple to super complex problems (using thousands of computations), and they all have two basic components, Operations and Tensors. As explained in the previous tutorials, the idea is that you create a model that consists of a set of operations, feed data in to the model and the tensors will flow between the operations until you get an output tensor, your result.\n",
    "\n",
    "When fully configured, TensorBoard window will look something like this:\n",
