In other words, the backbone of any Tensorflow program is going to be a __Graph__. As mentioned on the TensorFlow website, \"A __computational graph__ (or graph in short) is a series of TensorFlow operations arranged into a graph of nodes\".\n",

    "\n",

So we'll have one node for each operation; either for operations on tensors (like math operations) or generating tensors (like variables and constants). Each node takes zero or more tensors as inputs and produces a tensor as an output.\n",

To see how it works and how many arguments it needs, simply Google it and check the first link (TensorFlow official documentation). The documentation says it can be used like __tf.add(x, y, name=None)__ where x and y are the values to be added together and __name__ is the operation name, i.e. the name associated to the addition node on the graph.\n",

However, It does not spit out the result (2+3=5). Why?!\n",
